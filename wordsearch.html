          <h2>Project Description</h2>
          <p>
            This project is a bot to play <b>Cool Math Games'</b> "Word Search"
            for an indefinite period of time. Once a botting session is
            initiated, the program begins a new puzzle and solves it in full
            before moving on to the next generated puzzle. It repeats this
            process until the user requests an end to the botting session, or
            the bot fails to complete a puzzle, in which case it triggers an end
            to the botting session automatically and outputs a notification of
            the error.
          </p>
          <p>Code available for download on github.</p>

          <h3>Note</h3>
          <p>
            While this bot was built based on the game's 'Hard' difficulty
            conditions, it should be equally effective when set for 'Easy',
            'Medium', or 'Hard' difficulty. The bot, however, is not designed to
            solve puzzles in 'Maniac' difficulty due to the added time
            constraint and hidden word bank.
          </p>
          <h3>Update</h3>
          <p>
            As of January 2024, this project has been modified to limit the need
            for hardcoded data by generalizing code to function for any screen
            dimensions. Therefore, this program should be able to be run on any
            Windows computer that has the requirements.txt contents fulfilled
            and can display the full game window clearly while it is running.
            However, this shift puts some responsibility on the user that was
            not present previously to follow the instructions printed in the
            terminal at the start of running the program.

          <h2>Development Process</h2>
          <h3>Image Processing and Recognition</h3>
          <p>
            First, the program identifies the gamescreen's location on the
            user's screen and begins the botting session. Once a given puzzle
            appears, it is saved as an image from which the word bank column and
            the letter grid are separated into independent images and
            preprocessed for more accurate recognition. Pytesseract is used to
            extract data from the images of interest, converting the letter grid
            into a 2-D array of characters and the word bank into a list of
            twelve words.
          </p>
          <h3>Data Parsing</h3>
          <p>
            Next, each word in the word bank is broken into a list of characters
            that is then compared to the positions of characters in the letter
            grid. In order to do this, the program iterates over the letter
            grid, and if the letter at a given position is the same as the first
            letter of the desired word, it checks in each direction to see if
            the neighboring characters combine to spell out the desired word.
            Once the word's location is found in the grid, the row and column
            indexes of its first and last letter are saved.
          </p>
          <h3>Coordinate Conversion</h3>
          <p>
            Once the array positions of each word are determined in the letter
            grid, they are converted into pixel positions on the screen by
            multiplying the (col, row) values by the width and height of each
            cell of the letter grid plus one half of the width and height to get
            to the center point of each cell. These dimensions are determined by
            dividing the width and height of the grid's image by the number of
            columns/rows, respectively. Then, the resulting pixel pairs are
            incremented to account for the distance from the top-left corner of
            the user's screen to the top-left corner of the letter grid.
          </p>
          <h3>Mouse Automation</h3>
          <p>
            After the starting and ending pixel coordinates are logged for each
            word, the program utilizes pyautogui to navigate to the word's
            starting position, press down the left mouse key, and drag over the
            word before lifting the mouse key over its finaly position. When a
            word from the word bank is correctly selected, the game recognizes
            it as found, and the program proceeds to selecting the next word in
            the word bank. Once all the words in the word bank have been
            correctly selected, the puzzle is declared 'Solved', at which time
            the user has five seconds to press 'q' and terminate the botting
            session before the 'New Puzzle' button is pressed, and solving
            process restarts with a new data image.
          </p>
          <h3>Problems Encountered</h3>
          <p>
            Several major problems arose during the creation of this program,
            mainly as a reault of the limits of pytesseract.
          </p>
          <p>
            First of all, even after extensive experimentation with image
            preprocessing techniques, pytesseract was rarely able to accurately
            read in every letter of the word search grid. To help lessenthe
            damage of pytesseract skipping over or interpreting extra letters in
            the grid, each read-in letter was only added to the grid's data
            structure if it was identified in the position of an expected cell.
            If no letter was read-in at the position of an expected cell, an
            empty char was inserted into its position in the data structure to
            maintain the letters respective positions to each other. Then, once
            the data structure was filled, every item in the array listed as an
            empty char was re-evaluated by running pytesseract exclusively on
            the cropped region of the grid at that cell position. Any letters
            that were still undeterminable were left as an empty char in the 2-D
            array and treated like a "wild" space.
          </p>
          <p>
            Similarly, although most of the time, pytesseract read in the word
            bank fully and accurately, it would occassionally stop reading in
            after the second or third term line for some undetermined reason.
            Thus, to account for these odd occurrences, the program checks if
            all twelve words were added to the bank's data structure, and if
            not, reruns pytesseract under a different configuration to fill the
            word bank.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, while these solutions improved the accuracy of the
            data structures, pytesseract would still manage to misinterpret a
            letter that is added into the 2-D array. If one of these letters
            happened to be contained in one of the word bank words' positions on
            the grid, the word would be interpreted by the program as not
            existing in the grid. Therefore, if a target word is not found in
            the generated letter grid, the program iterates through each letter
            of the target word, setting one to an empty char (or a "wild") at a
            time, until the altered word is found in the letter grid. The
            thought process behind this band-aid solution is that if a few
            letters are misinterpreted by pytesseract, it is likely that each
            word from the word bank will not contain more than one
            misinterpreted letter. Thus, if the word is not found in the grid,
            but a word with all but one character being the same is, the latter
            is likely the missing word and its position in the grid can be
            interpreted as such.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2>Shortcomings</h2>
          <p>
            There are two identified cases where this program will fail to
            successfully complete a puzzle:
          </p>
          <p>
            * Since the band-aid solution noted above assumes only one character
            in a word had been mistinterpreted, it may fail to find words for
            which more than one of their characters has been read-in
            incorrectly. Additionally, if the puzzle does have an instance of a
            word bank term being off by one letter in the grid, that instance
            may be falsely noted as the position of the word.
          </p>
          <p>
            * Since the program searches for the first occurrence it can find of
            a word bank word, if said word occurs more than once in the puzzle
            and the game's intended solution for it is not the most upper left
            instance of the word, the program will attempt to select the wrong
            instance and the word will not be marked as found.
